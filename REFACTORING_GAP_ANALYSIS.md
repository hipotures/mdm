# MDM Refactoring Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

The MDM refactoring in `mdm-refactor-2025` fails at runtime because **79% of the storage backend methods** actually used by the codebase are missing from the new implementation.

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Methods in new interface | 9 |
| Methods actually used | 14 |
| Methods missing | 11 |
| **Failure rate** | **79%** |

## Critical Missing Methods

1. **`query()`** - Used 9 times
   - Critical for data retrieval
   - Used in CLI and API
   
2. **`create_table_from_dataframe()`** - Used 10 times  
   - Essential for data loading
   - Core to dataset registration

3. **`close_connections()`** - Used 7 times
   - Required for cleanup
   - Used in finally blocks

## Root Cause

**No API Analysis Phase**: The refactoring process skipped the critical step of analyzing what methods were actually being used before designing new interfaces.

```
❌ What Happened:
1. Test Stabilization
2. Abstraction Layer ← Designed interfaces from scratch!
3. Implementation

✅ What Should Have Happened:  
1. Test Stabilization
2. API ANALYSIS ← Measure what's actually used!
3. Abstraction Layer ← Based on analysis
4. Implementation
```

## Proof

Running the API analyzer (created post-mortem) shows:

```bash
$ python analyze_backend_api_usage.py src/mdm

Total unique methods called: 14
Total method calls: 62

Top methods:
- get_engine(): 11 calls
- create_table_from_dataframe(): 10 calls  
- query(): 9 calls
```

## Solution

1. **Run API analysis** before any refactoring
2. **Include ALL methods** in new interfaces
3. **Create adapters** with 100% compatibility
4. **Test with real implementations**, not mocks

## Lesson Learned

> "The best interface is the one that doesn't break existing code!"

The refactoring tried to create a "clean" interface but forgot the primary rule: **maintain compatibility first, improve design second**.
