# MDM Migration Steps - Detailed Plan

This directory contains a comprehensive, step-by-step migration plan for safely refactoring the MDM codebase. Each step is documented in its own file with detailed instructions, code examples, and validation criteria.

## Migration Timeline Overview

Total Duration: **22 weeks** (approximately 5.5 months)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL UPDATE**: Added Step 1.5 (API Analysis) after discovering that 79% of storage backend methods were missing from the new implementation. This step is now MANDATORY to prevent similar issues.

## Migration Steps

### Phase 0: Prerequisites and Preparation
- [00-prerequisites.md](00-prerequisites.md) - Initial setup and readiness assessment

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-5)
- [01-test-stabilization.md](01-test-stabilization.md) - Fix all failing tests (2 weeks)
- [01.5-api-analysis.md](01.5-api-analysis.md) - **CRITICAL**: Analyze actual API usage (1 week)
- [02-abstraction-layer.md](02-abstraction-layer.md) - Create interfaces and adapters (2 weeks)

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (Week 6)
- [03-parallel-setup.md](03-parallel-setup.md) - Set up parallel development environment (1 week)

### Phase 3: Component Migration (Weeks 7-18)
- [04-configuration-migration.md](04-configuration-migration.md) - Migrate configuration system (2 weeks)
- [05-storage-backend-migration.md](05-storage-backend-migration.md) - Migrate storage backends (3 weeks)
- [06-feature-engineering-migration.md](06-feature-engineering-migration.md) - Migrate feature engineering (3 weeks)
- [07-dataset-registration-migration.md](07-dataset-registration-migration.md) - Migrate dataset registration (4 weeks)

### Phase 4: Validation and Cutover (Weeks 19-20)
- [08-validation-and-cutover.md](08-validation-and-cutover.md) - Final validation and switch (2 weeks)

### Phase 5: Cleanup (Weeks 21-22)
- [09-cleanup-and-finalization.md](09-cleanup-and-finalization.md) - Remove old code and finalize (2 weeks)

## Quick Reference

| Step | Duration | Critical Dependencies | Risk Level |
|------|----------|----------------------|------------|
| Prerequisites | - | None | Low |
| Test Stabilization | 2 weeks | None | Medium |
| **API Analysis** | **1 week** | **Green tests** | **CRITICAL** |
| Abstraction Layer | 2 weeks | API Analysis | Low |
| Parallel Setup | 1 week | Abstractions | Low |
| Config Migration | 2 weeks | Parallel env | Medium |
| Storage Migration | 3 weeks | Config system | High |
| Feature Migration | 3 weeks | Storage layer | High |
| Registration Migration | 4 weeks | Features | High |
| Validation | 2 weeks | All migrations | Medium |
| Cleanup | 2 weeks | Stable system | Low |

## Migration Principles

1. **MEASURE BEFORE DESIGNING** - Analyze actual API usage before creating interfaces
2. **Never break the working system** - All changes must be backward compatible
3. **Test everything** - Every change must have tests
4. **Validate continuously** - Run comparison tests after each change
5. **Feature flag everything** - All new code behind flags
6. **Document everything** - Update docs as you go

## Emergency Procedures

If something goes wrong at any step:
1. Check [emergency-rollback.md](emergency-rollback.md)
2. Use feature flags to disable problematic code
3. Revert commits if necessary
4. Document the issue in migration log

## Progress Tracking

Use the [migration-checklist.md](migration-checklist.md) to track progress across all steps.

## Support

For questions or issues during migration:
1. Check the specific step documentation
2. Review the troubleshooting guide in each step
3. Consult the team lead before making architectural decisions

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Discovery (2025-07)
During the MDM refactoring, we discovered that **79% of storage backend methods** were missing from the new implementation because Step 1.5 (API Analysis) was skipped. This caused runtime failures when the new "clean" interface didn't match actual usage.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Always analyze actual API usage before designing new interfaces
- "Clean architecture" must be balanced with compatibility requirements
- Mocking in tests can hide missing methods - use real implementations
- See [CRITICAL_FIX_Missing_API_Analysis.md](CRITICAL_FIX_Missing_API_Analysis.md) for details

### Required Reading
Before starting ANY refactoring:
1. [01.5-api-analysis.md](01.5-api-analysis.md) - How to analyze API usage
2. [LESSONS_LEARNED_API_Analysis.md](../LESSONS_LEARNED_API_Analysis.md) - What went wrong
3. [storage_backend_api_reference.md](../storage_backend_api_reference.md) - Complete API documentation
