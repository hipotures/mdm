# MDM Migration Checklist

## Overview

This checklist tracks progress across all migration steps. Check off items as completed.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Step 1.5 (API Analysis) was added after discovering missing methods. This step is now MANDATORY.

## Phase 0: Prerequisites

- [x] Development environment setup
- [x] All dependencies installed
- [x] Git workflow established
- [x] Team briefing complete

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-5)

### Step 1: Test Stabilization (Weeks 1-2)
- [x] All unit tests passing
- [x] All integration tests passing
- [x] All E2E tests passing
- [x] Test coverage baseline established

### Step 1.5: API Analysis (Week 3) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NEW STEP
- [ ] **Storage backend API analysis complete**
- [ ] **Feature engineering API analysis complete**
- [ ] **Dataset registrar API analysis complete**
- [ ] **Generated interfaces from actual usage**
- [ ] **Compatibility test suite created**
- [ ] **Documentation of all methods in use**

### Step 2: Abstraction Layer (Weeks 4-5)
- [ ] Storage backend Protocol created (with ALL methods from analysis)
- [ ] Feature engineering Protocol created
- [ ] Dataset registrar Protocol created
- [ ] All adapters implemented
- [ ] Adapter tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Phase 2: Infrastructure (Week 6)

### Step 3: Parallel Setup
- [x] Feature flag system implemented
- [x] Parallel testing framework ready
- [x] Comparison testing tools built
- [x] Monitoring in place

## Phase 3: Component Migration (Weeks 7-18)

### Step 4: Configuration Migration (Weeks 7-8)
- [x] New configuration system implemented
- [x] Environment variable mapping works
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] All config tests passing

### Step 5: Storage Backend Migration (Weeks 9-11)
- [ ] ‚ùå All storage methods implemented (FAILED - missing 79%)
- [ ] Connection pooling working
- [ ] All backend tests passing
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Parallel comparison tests passing

### Step 6: Feature Engineering Migration (Weeks 12-14)
- [ ] Pipeline architecture implemented
- [ ] All feature types migrated
- [ ] Custom feature support added
- [ ] Feature tests passing
- [ ] Performance optimized

### Step 7: Dataset Registration Migration (Weeks 15-18)
- [ ] Command pattern implemented
- [ ] All 12 steps migrated
- [ ] Rollback mechanism working
- [ ] Progress tracking implemented
- [ ] All registration tests passing

## Phase 4: Validation (Weeks 19-20)

### Step 8: Validation and Cutover
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance validation complete
- [ ] Load testing successful
- [ ] Rollout plan executed
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards live

## Phase 5: Cleanup (Weeks 21-22)

### Step 9: Cleanup and Finalization
- [ ] Legacy code removed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Migration artifacts archived
- [ ] Post-mortem conducted
- [ ] Celebration complete! üéâ

## Critical Checkpoints

### Before proceeding past Step 2:
- [ ] API analysis shows 100% method coverage
- [ ] All methods from analysis are in interfaces
- [ ] No "idealistic" methods without usage evidence

### Before starting Storage Migration:
- [ ] Verify all 14 storage methods are implemented
- [ ] Run test with REAL backend, not mocks
- [ ] Compare method signatures with actual usage

### Before Validation:
- [ ] All components using actual implementations
- [ ] No mock-based integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests exercise all code paths

## Red Flags üö©

If you see any of these, STOP and investigate:

1. Interface has methods not found in usage analysis
2. Tests use mocks instead of real implementations
3. "Clean" design that doesn't match current usage
4. Missing methods discovered at runtime
5. Feature flags not working properly

## Sign-offs

Each phase requires sign-off before proceeding:

| Phase | Lead | Date | Notes |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| Prerequisites | | | |
| Foundation | | | Must include API analysis |
| Infrastructure | | | |
| Component Migration | | | Each component separately |
| Validation | | | Performance must meet targets |
| Cleanup | | | All legacy code removed |
