# MDM Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for refactoring MDM (ML Data Manager) from its current monolithic architecture to a clean, modular, and maintainable system. The refactoring addresses critical architectural issues including god classes, singleton anti-patterns, tight coupling, and poor testability.

- Communication and training plans

### 💾 [Storage Backend Refactoring](./Storage_Backend_Refactoring.md)
**Addresses singleton anti-patterns in storage layer**
- Problems: Stateful base class, singleton pattern, poor connection management
- Solution: Stateless backends, connection pooling, dependency injection
- Migration: Adapter pattern for backward compatibility
- Testing: Parallel implementation testing

### 🔧 [Feature Engineering Redesign](./Feature_Engineering_Redesign.md)
**Transforms god class into flexible pipeline architecture**
- Problems: Monolithic FeatureGenerator, hard-coded features, mixed concerns
- Solution: Pipeline pattern, plugin architecture, clean transformers
- Migration: Step-by-step transformer implementation
- Extensibility: Custom transformer development guide

### ⚙️ [Configuration System Overhaul](./Configuration_System_Overhaul.md)
**Consolidates multiple config systems into unified solution**
- Problems: Multiple config classes, hardcoded env mappings, global state
- Solution: Pydantic-based settings, clean env var mapping, DI integration
- Migration: Configuration adapter for compatibility
- Validation: Comprehensive configuration validation

### 📦 [Dataset Registrar Refactoring](./Dataset_Registrar_Refactoring.md)
**Breaks up 1000+ line god class into manageable components**
- Problems: 12 tightly-coupled steps, instance state, mixed concerns
- Solution: Command pattern, registration pipeline, clean steps
- Benefits: Testability, flexibility, error recovery
- Implementation: Individual step classes with rollback

### 🧪 [Testing Strategy](./Testing_Strategy.md)
**Comprehensive testing approach for the refactoring**
- Test pyramid: 60% unit, 30% integration, 10% E2E
- Coverage goals: 95%+ for unit tests
- Migration testing: Parallel old vs new testing
- Performance: Benchmarking and memory profiling

## Critical Issues Addressed

1. **Storage Backend Singleton** 
   - Prevents multi-database handling
   - Makes testing difficult
   - Solution: Stateless backends with connection pooling

2. **Feature Engineering God Class**
   - 200+ lines doing everything
   - Not extensible
   - Solution: Pipeline pattern with plugins

3. **Configuration Chaos**
   - Multiple overlapping systems
   - Hardcoded special cases
   - Solution: Unified Pydantic-based config

4. **Dataset Registrar Monolith**
   - 1000+ lines with 12 coupled steps
   - Poor error recovery
   - Solution: Command pattern with pipeline

5. **Poor Testability**
   - Global state everywhere
   - Tight coupling
   - Solution: Dependency injection throughout

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- ✅ Dependency injection framework
- ✅ Configuration system
- ✅ Path management

### Phase 2: Core Refactoring (Weeks 3-6)
- ✅ Storage backend refactoring
- ✅ Feature engineering pipeline
- ✅ Plugin architecture

### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement (Weeks 7-8)
- ✅ Dataset registration pipeline
- ✅ Progress tracking separation
- ✅ Error recovery mechanisms

### Phase 4: Integration (Weeks 9-10)
