# MDM Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for refactoring MDM (ML Data Manager) from its current monolithic architecture to a clean, modular, and maintainable system. The refactoring addresses critical architectural issues including god classes, singleton anti-patterns, tight coupling, and poor testability.

**Note**: MDM is designed for single-user deployment. The refactoring maintains this focus, avoiding unnecessary complexity that would come with multi-user or enterprise features. All monitoring, configuration, and operational aspects are optimized for individual use.
